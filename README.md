In this particular project, a very popular topic nowadays is going to be presented and discussed, more precisely, loan prediction with the help of Machine Learning (ML). The paper aims to understand whether a person will get a loan or not, and what are the main features affecting the final decision. We will introduce and state the problem we got and discuss the importance of solving that problem. Afterwards, we will point out which methods are applicable for this project, choose the best one, and explain our choice. The next step will include describing the dataset itself, on hand with its features and preprocessing. Last but not least, we will introduce the actual experiment and show the final results. The final step will include our thoughts for the future, and what could be done to improve the results. 
Keywords: loan prediction, logistic regression, decision tree classification, machine learning.
